# Ufirst-Admin
Admin Web App Dashboard for Ufirst mobile app

This admin console will allow our customer (the admin) to view and manage the users of the application. The console will also allow trainers to sign up as well and manage their clients' details through the console. Trainers will be able to create and assign meal and workout plans to their clients. The admin will be able to view which clients are assigned to which trainers, and will be able to facilitate the association between the two. The admin will also be able to delete any partnerships between trainer and client if need be.
